             *Location: Villupuram district, Tamil Nadu, India (about 160 km from Chennai and 37 km from Thiruvannamalai).
             *Other Names: Senji Fort, Chenji Fort, or "Troy of the East" â€“ because of its strong fortifications.

             Originally built in the 9th century by the Chola dynasty, later developed by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 13th century.
             It passed through the hands of several rulers: Marathas, Mughals, French, and British.
             Shivaji, the Maratha king, captured it in 1677.
             In 1698, the Mughals took control after a long siege.
             The British finally took it over in 1761.
