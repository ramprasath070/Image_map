            **Gingee lies right on NH 77, making it a key junction for travelers and transport between northern Tamil Nadu and the Western Ghats region.

            **This road is commonly used by pilgrims visiting Tiruvannamalai and travelers heading towards Bangalore or Hosur.
            **Mostly a 2-lane highway, being upgraded in some parts.

            **Scenic with plenty of greenery and small hills, especially near Gingee Fort.
            **NH 77 makes Gingee a busy bus stop, with TNSTC buses frequently stopping en route to Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, and more.
